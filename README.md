# text-compress-and-decompress
This program compresses and decompresses text files using Huffman tree
This is a project for the data structure course done by 4 students including me.
I was working on creating the huffman tree and the key file used for compressing and decompressing.
The program takes a long time if it's used on a large file due to a problem with the way the file is read to create the linked list that contains all the characters used and how much they are used.
